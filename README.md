# Validate-Anagrams-using-Python
An Anagram is a word or phrase that forms a different word or phrase when the letters of a word are rearranged. For example, the words “despair” and “praised” are anagrams. 

The validation of anagram words is one of the favourite questions in coding interviews. The idea is to write an algorithm to check if the input word creates a meaningful word when
rearranged. So to validate an anagram using Python, we need to input two words and check if word1 in any case matches word2 after rearranging the words.

For example, the words “cinema” and “Iceman”, let’s say that the word1 here is “cinema”, so we need to write an algorithm to check whether we can make the word “Iceman” after 
rearranging the letters of the word “cinema”.
